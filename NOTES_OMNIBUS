Omnibus:

 + Inspiration from: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server.
   View: https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software


 + Use omnibus to install non-specific dependencies, like php, apache, nginx, etc., to /opt/scalr/embedded/...
 + Use omnibus to install chef-solo (as a gem, in the embedded location, too).

 + Use omnibus-ctl (https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-ctl) and its "reconfigure" command to launch Chef solo.
 + Use a regular cookbook to initialize (runtime).
 + Use a configuration file on the system (/etc/scalr-server/scalr-server.rb -- https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-chef-server) to configure the components, etc.

Config files considerations:

 + `solo.json` for the runlist.
 + `/etc/scalr-server/scalr-server.rb` for user configuration.
 + Exclusively *declare* attributes in the `scalr-server.rb` file. No auto-generated passwords there.
   -> Also include whether services are enabled or not.
 + Store auto-generated passwords in `/etc/scalr-server/scalr-server-secrets.json`.



IN THE CONFIGURATION FILE, YOU MUST SKIP *default[:scalr_server]*

Make sure that when we convert to omnibus, DNA.json includes stuff like rackspace_timezone that
still needs to run!
